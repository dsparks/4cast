# NWS Forecast â€” v4.2.3

- Based on the last known-good v4.2.
- Fix: charts destroyed/rebuilt on search (graphs now change with new locations).
- Crosshair & hover from any facet (shared X).
- Default tooltip disabled; **floating value tags** at the crosshair (WU-style).
- Night shading, midnight dividers, **date labels** on top facet, hour-only titles.
- Still static and GitHub Pages ready.
