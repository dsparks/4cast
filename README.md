# NWS Forecast — v4.1

Changes requested:
1. **Midnight dividers** across all facets (darker vertical lines).
2. **Humidity + Cloud Cover + Chance of Precip** combined into one chart.
3. **Precipitation (in)** on its own compressed chart. Removed accumulation line.
4. **Wind speed** on its own chart (unchanged).
5. **Pressure** facet now appears only if data is available from the grid endpoint (inHg).

Everything is still static and GitHub Pages–ready.
