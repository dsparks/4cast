# NWS Forecast — v4.3

Bug fix & polish:
- Search bug fixed — charts are destroyed/rebuilt when you search; graphs now reflect the new location.
- Tooltip position moved away from cursor.
- Hour-only titles, date labels, midnight dividers, emoji day strip, etc.

About "10 days":
NWS hourly/grid feeds provide ~6–7 days of hourly data, not 10. Full 10-day requires another source.
